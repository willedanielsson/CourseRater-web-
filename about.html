		<h2>Idea</h2>
		<p> 
			The idea behind CourseRater is that students can evaluate and rate courses that they have taken. The easy rating system simplifies the evaluation progress as students rate each part of the course separately and can also leave comments for every part of the course. The ratings and comments are anonymous and the overall rating of the course is displayed for everyone.</p>

		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>	
			It can sometimes be difficult to understand the content and quality of a course by reading the information provided by the university. Unfortunately, students often realize that a course is not their cup of tea when it's too late or troublesome to change.<br>

			We hope that the ratings and comments from students that have already taken the course will aid other students in their choices. It is a students-help-students relation with CourseRater as an intermediary.<br>
		</p>
		<h2>Consequences</h2>
		<p>
			It can take a long time until a crappy course is changed or removed as long as unknowing students is taking it. Our ambition is that we can contribute to change these courses by providing the ratings from earlier students. This can be achieved since the course administrator will be forced to modify the course if the attendance is rapidly decreasing. The administrator can report any changes in the course to us which in turn will be displayed for students.<br>
